/**
 * [ImagePlacement] is used to wrap the [name] keyword and allow for an extendable string enum used to give a hint to

 * reuse the same view class where the designer requires different layout constraints for the image depending upon what
 * the image is showing.
 *
 * For example,
 * - An image of a person's midsection will look strange if the image does not "cut off" at the edges of the screen so
 * should be constrained to the edges. This is described using [ImagePlacement.Standard.TopBackground].
 * - An image of a person standing should be constrained to below the phone status bar so that the person is not
 * decapitated. This is described using [ImagePlacement.Standard.TopMarginBackground].
 * - An image of a trophy or smiley face should fit the screen real-estate with a size constraint and margins. This is
 * described using [ImagePlacement.Standard.IconBefore] or [ImagePlacement.Standard.IconAfter].

     *      Display the image "before" the content. For a portrait orientation, this would indicate that the image should
     *      be displayed *above* the content. For landscape orientation, this would indicate that for languages that read

     *      Display the image "after" the content. For portrait orientation, this would be *below* the content. For
     *      landscape orientation for languages that read left to right, the image should be on the *right*.

     *      Display the image full size in the background of the view.
     * - [TopBackground]:
     *      Top half of the background constrained to the top of the screen rather than to the safe area. On platforms that
     *      support drawing the image under the status bar and in the area of the "notch", this would draw in that area.

     *      half of the view.
